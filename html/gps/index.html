<h2>New Age</h2>
<p>The New Age is a term applied to a range of spiritual or religious beliefs and practices that developed in Western nations during the 1970s. Precise scholarly definitions of the movement differ in their emphasis, largely as a result of its highly eclectic structure.</p>

<aside>
Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods.</aside>

1.The purpose of the HTML5 semantic tags is to help nagivate through the html code. I found the nav and footer tag to be the most useful.
2.The order the browser uses to display elements on a page is top to bottom.
3.I learned how to make my own snippets on sublime. Yes, as I get more experience I'm sure i will create more snippets.
4.The hardest part in this challenge was understanding the semantic tags. I can improve by googling what is exactly does and using them.
